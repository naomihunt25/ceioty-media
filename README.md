## Project description

This project is designed for Unit 1: User-Centric Front-End Development, the project involves the design and development of a front-end web application. For the purpose of this project, I have chosen to create a website for **Ceioty Media**, a fictional drone service company that offers drone filming, photography and survey inspection services. This website will be designed with a focus on user experience (UX), utilising responsive design principles, effective content layout, and intuitive navigation to ensure the site is user-friendly across all devices.

Though the business context is based on Ceioty Media, the core focus of this project is to apply the web development principles I have learnt in the course so far, demonstrating the skills required to build a functional, professional, and engaging website.

The website will be designed to work across all device types, ensuring an optimal viewing experience for users on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. It will adjust seamlessly to different screen sizes without losing content structure or usability.

2. **Content layout**:

3. **User-centric interface**:

Features like quick navigation, easy-to-read fonts, and fast load times will be prioritised for ease of access. The content will also be optimised for accessibility, providing an inclusive experience for all users.

4. **Interactive elements**:
The website will feature interactive elements, such as hover effects and image sliders, making the site engaging and user-friendly. This will encourage users to explore the services offered and contact the company.

## Design choices
For the design of the website, I opted for a sleek and minimalistic aesthetic for a clean, modern, and professional user experience. The goal was to create a website that is visually appealing without overwhelming the user with unnecessary elements or clutter. By keeping the design minimal, I aimed to focus attention on the core content including services, portfolio, and contact information, making it easy for visitors to navigate and absorb the important details of the business. This approach also enhances usability and ensures that the website looks polished across all devices and screen sizes, aligning with the principles of responsive design.

### Typography choices
1. Primary Font: Exo
I chose Exo as the primary font for the website due to its modern, geometric, and clean design. The font features sharp edges and clear lines that convey professionalism that are essential for a drone services business. Its legibility at various sizes, particularly in headers and titles, ensures that the text remains easily readable across different devices. Additionally, Exo has a futuristic feel, aligning with the technological and innovative nature of the drone industry.

2. Secondary Font: Nunito
For the secondary font, I chose Nunito for its rounded, approachable, and soft appearance. This font complements Exo by offering a contrast in terms of shape and tone. Nunito provides a sense of warmth and friendliness, balancing the more technical and modern look of Exo. This makes it ideal for body text, as it is easy to read and creates a welcoming atmosphere for visitors. 

The combination of both fonts results in a harmonious and professional design, with Exo bringing a contemporary, high-tech vibe, while Nunito enhances readability and user engagement.

### Icons
For the icons used throughout the website, I ensured that they were simple, intuitive, and easily understood. By using widely recognised icons, I aimed to reduce any potential confusion and improve the overall user experience. The use of recognisable icons enhances the website's accessibility, as users can quickly understand the meaning of each icon contributing to a clean, uncluttered interface that focuses on content and interaction.

### Colour palette
The colour palette for the website was chosen with both aesthetic appeal and accessibility in mind. The primary colour is deep teal (#005C6E), reflecting the company's coastal roots in Pembrokeshire, where much of their portfolio work focuses on capturing stunning coastline views.

### Accessibility testing
I utilised Lighthouse within the Google DevTools to review the colours and fonts used. The outcomes are displayed below. Lighthouse also evaluates areas such as Performance, SEO, and Best Practices.

**Index page** <br>
![lighthouse result index page](assets/images/lighthouse-index.webp)

**Services page** <br>
![lighthouse result services page](assets/images/lighthouse-services.webp)

**Portfolio page** <br>
![lighthouse result portfolio page](assets/images/lighthouse-portfolio.webp) <br>
The portfolio page received a score of 77 for performance and 78 for best practices during the Google DevTools Lighthouse audit.<br>

*Performance*: The page scored 77 because, although the images were compressed and converted to the WebP format to optimise loading times, the high-quality images used were necessary to showcase the drone services effectively. This aligns with the requirements of User Story 4, which emphasised presenting high-resolution visuals to highlight the offerings. Additionally, YouTube videos were embedded instead of using the video tag, helping to improve loading speed by utilising YouTube's optimised streaming infrastructure.<br>

![lighthouse result portfolio page](assets/images/lighthouse-portfolio-best-practices.webp) <br>
*Best practices*: The score of 78 was impacted by warnings about the use of third-party cookies, which arose from embedding YouTube videos. Since these cookies are an inherent part of YouTube's embedding functionality, they could not be modified or removed.
